- Dragging and Dropping of the Boards is working properly(thanks to the dnd-kit package)
- When inside of a canvas the name of canvas is showing at the taskbar
- the routing structure is implimented (using react-router)
- thats it

## What i am working on

- get the app to the beta release state
- Storing the data locally (will use json)
- Adding markdown engine to the cards

## If you want to run locally

1. Install tauri (https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) and nodejs(https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. clone this repo and run :

```bash
npm i
```

3.  now run :

```bash
npm run tauri app
